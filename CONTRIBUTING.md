## Report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
